        <h4 style="text-align: justify">
            Arlecchino, also known by her codename "The Knave," is a playable Pyro character in Genshin Impact.

            She is the Fourth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and the current director of the House of the Hearth. She is addressed as "Father" by members of the house, whom she calls her "children."

        As one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, Arlecchino is, unlike most Harbingers, likely unloyal to the Tsaritsa.[2] She is working to achieve her goals by acquiring the Gnoses on her behalf. She handles Fatui matters with utmost importance and comes off as graceful and cordial. Although she is strict, she is more lenient than her predecessor, having imposed a more relaxed policy for her subordinates to complete their goals and does not punish them as severely for failure. While she does not like betrayal, she is not as cruel, as she was willing to spare traitors who demonstrated sufficient willpower by "executing" their identity in the House rather than outright killing them.

She is also addressed as "Father" by the House of the Hearth's members. However, it is suggested by her fellow Harbingers that she simply puts up an act in front of others, believing she has ulterior motives, feigning loyalty and that those who see her true, crazed nature vanish without a trace.[3]

Despite claiming to be a Fontanian, Arlecchino actually hails from Khaenri'ah. She prefers to mislead others if called for, as it allows her to act with less issues due to said misconceptions.[citation needed] She also appears to have a soft spot for children, seeing that many members of the House of the Hearth are young and orphaned children taken in across Teyvat and views them all as her "children," becoming particularly angered when their well-being is threatened or manipulated.[4][5]
